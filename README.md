# counterjs
An extremely simple, super lightweight and no trills JavaScript plugin for handling countdowns or timer operations.

# How to get started

There are two ways in which to use this plugin. JQuery is super great at what it is does but not everyone wishes to use it. Due to this, the ability to use the plugin without jQuery is catered for!

```html

<span id="counter" data-begin="10"></span>

```
